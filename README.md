# Jog on!

Ever been to a bar and had a few drinks and been staring at that gorgeous woman/man across the bar that's you think has been smiling at you.

You finally pluck up the courage to go and have a chat and then realise they were looking at the person behind you , and tell you to " JOG ON! "

App, JOG ON!

Thought out and designed to as much precision as possible and to timing that didn’t really fit the bill .

After 3 months of studies and lack of sleep.
From HTML- CSS to Github to Javascript and jQuery, Ruby and Rails, Frameworks, Bootstrap  and finally the BEAST……..
ANGULAR!

The Jog On app was built on a diet of Angular and Javascript .
The distance covered, 2 models  and controllers that seemed to be controlling the next controller.
The route taken was painful but enjoyable in the same breath.

#### Things that I learnt from this project:
-  Preparation and selection of which API to use is key.
-  Take things slowly and test everything, there are no shortcuts.

#### What did I enjoy about this project:
-  Celebrate the small wins!!!
-  Being able to get the map up and getting a marker on the page initially .
-  Being able to Drag the marker along a route.

#### What did I find difficult about this project:

##### ANGULAR!

-  Changing the destination point to be able to drag the pointer to the next point, as Angular Maps only reads maps as Origin to destination with waypoints imbetween.

-  ANGULAR

And obviously 

-  ANGULAR!!

#### What would I add if i had more time?

##### The list is endless:
-  Distance markers
-  Directions
-  Ability to link runs with different users
-  Heatmaps of most used runs
-  Race timers 

As much as Angular has given me Nightmare, I can see how powerful a tool this can be. I love what is does, but getting there is a massive struggle.

#### The technologies I used were:
-  Angular
-  Angular Material
-  Angular Maps
-  MongoDB
-  Passport
-  Bcrypt
-  Express.js
